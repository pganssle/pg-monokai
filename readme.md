## PG-Monokai
This is the theme I use on SublimeText 3, which I constructed when I should have been working on my PhD thesis. It is loosely based on the Monokai theme, which I found to be almost right, but with not quite enough contrast. I found that many dark themes tend to use grey or some other low-contrast color for comments and docstrings, which I really did not like, since I think a comment in code should be drawing your attention.

This is primarily intended for use with the [PythonImproved](https://github.com/MattDMo/PythonImproved) plugin, which (among other things), distinguishes between single- and double-quoted docstrings. The theme is designed so that double-quoted multi-line strings are interpreted as docstrings, while single-quoted multi-line strings are interpreted as code that has been commented out (it is thus given a muted lower-contrast color, so it doesn't pop like a real comment should).
